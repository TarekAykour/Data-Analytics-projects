    Journalists write their articles and select relevant images to go along with the story.

    These images are then fed into the image captioning program (instead of manually insert description for each image).

    The program processes these images and generates a text file with the suggested captions for each image.

    The journalists or editors review these captions. They might use them as they are, or they might modify them to better fit the context of the article.

    These approved captions then serve a dual purpose:

        Enhanced accessibility: The captions are integrated as alternative text (alt text) for the images in the online article. Visually impaired users, using screen readers, can understand the context of the images through these descriptions. It helps them to have a similar content consumption experience as sighted users, adhering to the principles of inclusive and accessible design.

        Improved SEO: Properly captioned images with relevant keywords improve the article's SEO. Search engines like Google consider alt text while indexing, and this helps the article to appear in relevant search results, thereby driving organic traffic to the agency's website. This is especially useful for image search results.

    Once the captions are approved, they are added to the images in the online article.
